# Discord.fm by mr_miner

A Discord Plugin which adds cool commands to get cool information from last.fm.

Currently launching in beta as i feel the plugin isnt close to complete and i could add a lot more stuff to but i wanted to see the feedback and reception i get for the plugin and then determine how much time and effort i spend on developing it also wanna know if anyone even uses last.fm smh. so i would love some feedback! ~~and stars~~
